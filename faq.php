        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Question: I have mold on my bathroom tile, is this a
            mold hazard?</strong></dt>

            <dd>Usually this is a common house cleaning and maintenance issue.
            The mold types are usually common to outdoors such as Cladosporium.
            Cleaning mold with a tile and grout cleaner agent and abrasive
            sponge is the best first approach. In some cases old tile must be
            replaced. We routinely inspect for these conditions.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Question: I see dark or black mold, is this a health
            hazard?</strong></dt>

            <dd>There are important factors in understanding mold and air
            quality issues. For example are you allergic or sensitive to molds.
            If so, you may be more concerned about molds regardless of the
            type. Generally people who are sensitive to mold should be
            concerned about mold as a condition in their home or building. A
            black mold or dark mold may not necessarily be an immediate health
            concern. The hazards associated with mold have more to do with how
            much mold is in the air and potentially part of your living space.
            Our inspection addresses these concerns so that our clients are
            educated regarding mold and air quality.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Question: What comes first, the inspection or the air
            sampling? Is air sampling representative of a property
            condition?</strong></dt>

            <dd>The inspection is a means to provide our clients with
            information about their proticular property. Air sampling provides
            clients with additional information regarding spore counts and mold
            species. Levels found have direct correlation with the results of
            the visual inspection.</dd>

            <dd>These are typically found to be mineral deposits created by
            moisture moving through the block walls. Ispections help to
            identity these conditons and create solutions to keep properties
            maintained.</dd>
