            <h2>What is a Mold Inspection?</h2>


            <p>Initially, a mold inspection is visual. We look closely at areas
            of a home where mold may be prone to grow such as in basements,
            attics, crawl spaces, bathrooms, kitchens, or areas where known
            water infiltration has occurred. We look in utility rooms, under
            accessible stair wells, and in some areas you wouldn't
            consider.</p>


            <p>We use special source lighting so we can see what surfaces look
            like in full detail. We also look at certain elements of suspect
            HVAC systems to identify if mold may be within ductwork or fan/coil
            housing units. We utilize tools such as moisture meters,
            hygrometers (relative humidity), fiber optic scopes (to look within
            wall cavities), and an Infra-Red camera which can detect moisture
            in walls and in ceiling systems.</p>

            <h3>Surface and Air Sampling Practices</h3>

            <p>Air tests are performed by collecting a known volume of airborne
            particulate through a special cartridge which contains a
            pre-treated slide. The air is pumped at a known rate which passes
            over this slide depositing mold spores resident in the rooms being
            tested. Samples are taken inside the subject areas and outside as
            well in order to gain a reference to compare types of molds
            (Qualitative) and concentration (Quantitative) mold levels. The
            indoor and outdoor results are compared to indicate if there is an
            abnormal difference between indoor vs. outdoor.</p>

            <h4>RTS Utilizes a Third-Party Nationally Recognized and Accredited
            Laboratory</h4>

            <p>A surface sample taken by a swab, tape slide, or by bulk
            sampling can be microscopically analyzed (called microanalysis) to
            determine the mold type. By using a third party laboratory, you can
            be sure that the results of our testing are genuine.</p>

                for the Client</h3>

                <p>Our inspectors will guide you through your home and suggest
                methods for you to limit the spread of moisture or mold in areas
                commonly affected. These methods are often very simple and cost
                effective, saving you time and money.</p>

                <h3>Infra-Red Thermal Technology</h3>


                <p>Thermal Imaging is performed using an infrared camera. This
                camera is designed to detect small changes in temperature relative
                to the spectrum of light in the range of infrared energy. This
                technology helps discover building problems otherwise not visible
                with the human eye.</p>

            <h2>Top Quality Mold Remediation Services</h2>


            <p>According to the U.S. EPA, "The purpose of mold remediation is
            to remove the mold and prevent human exposure and further
            contamination to building materials and furnishings." (see <a href=
            "http://www.epa.gov/mold/" target=
            "_blank">http://www.epa.gov/mold/</a>)</p>


            <p>When a mold growth scenario is substantial enough or
            circumstances require remediation methods and practices, the
            following are considerations in performing mold remediation:</p>


            <ul>
                <li>Containment - Using plastic barriers or enclosures to
                confine and control the working area and minimize further
                airborne contamination in other portions of the building.</li>


                <li>Air controls - The use of negative air pressures during
                remediation help control air by maintaining a flow of air
                through a filtered air handler assembly situated in the
                containment area and exhausted to outdoors. The large volume of
                air which is flowing through the negative air unit provides a
                continuous draw of negative pressure which removes all
                particulate from the air continuously.</li>


                <li>Anti-fungal treatments - Cleaning solutions are used in the
                remediation process which kill active mold growth and render
                remaining mold spores non-viable to grow mold.. Anti-fungal
                treatments and sealants are applied to wall cavities and walls
                as part of the remediation process for example.Protective gear-
                Those performing remediation will wear protective clothing or
                respiratory protection in many of the remediation processes
                when exposure to mold will occur.</li>
